  "The clitoris is the pleasure center of the vulva. It doesn't have a central role in reproduction like the penis or vagina â€” it's pretty much just there to make you feel good! The clitoris is right under the point where the inner labia meet and form a little hood (known as the clitoral hood, in fact).",
  "The clitoris is one of the most sensitive erogenous zones due to its high concentration of nerve endings. By stimulating it, a sexual physiological response can be set into motion. The clitoris is part of the vulva, the name for the external parts of female genitalia.",
  "The clitoris is part of the female reproductive organs. Due to its high level of sensitivity, the clitoris is usually the main player when it comes to the female orgasm.",
  "The clitoris is a female genital organ. Most of the clitoris is hidden inside the body. Only a small part of it is seen outside the body. Adding the outside and inside parts, the clitoris is about the same size as the penis.",
  "The clitoris is a female genital organ. During sexual arousal, erectile tissue of the clitoris fills with blood. This causes the clitoris to grow. It grows until orgasm happens."
