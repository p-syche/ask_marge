  "Sperm are the male reproductive cells. Most animals and plants use sperm to reproduce. They have different ways of making and releasing the sperm. In all cases the sperm meets with the egg of the female and grow into a new organism.",
  "Human sperm is made in the testicles of a man. During sex, semen is shot out of the man's penis during ejaculation. Semen carries the sperm into the woman's vagina.",
  "Sperm are male cells created for sexual reproduction. It's carried in the semen. Semen (pronounced SEE-men or SEE-mən) is the fluid that comes out from the end of a man's penis when he has an orgasm (the height of sexual excitement) and ejaculates.",
  "Semen is a “viscous, creamy, slightly yellowish or greyish” substance made up of spermatozoa — commonly known as sperm — and a fluid called seminal plasma. In other words, semen contains two separate components: the sperm and the fluid.",
  "Semen is a white or grey liquid, emitted from the urethra (tube in the penis) on ejaculation. Usually, each millilitre of semen contains millions of spermatozoa (sperm), but the majority of the volume consists of secretions of the glands in the male reproductive organs.",
  "Semen is the cloudy white bodily fluid that is emitted from the urethra and out of the penis during ejaculation. It consists of mobile sperm cells (called spermatozoa) and a nutrient-rich fluid called seminal fluid. The purpose of the seminal fluid is to both transport the sperm cells and enhance their fertilization abilities."
